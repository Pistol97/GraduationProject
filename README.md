# Project SONAR

Project SONAR is a short horror adventure game.

People rely heavily on sight among the five senses. If it was originally, I created the game imagining what would happen when the things I had seen were not properly visible. And Inspired by the submarine's use of sonar in the water.

It is designed to make the player feel unknown fear by using only 'SONAR' equipment that shows only the outline of the surrounding objects in a trapped space where nothing is seen.
